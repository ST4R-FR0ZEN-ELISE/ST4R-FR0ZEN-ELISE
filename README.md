Please don't use he/him pronouns towards me! I don't mind any other, but my prefered pronouns are she/they! I am a demigirl and a lesbian!

˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ INT! - I don't mind anyone interacting with me, as long as they are not apart of my DNI list or just look for a fight. I will treat you as equal no matter your age, but please don't act weird about it. I might be too scared to talk to you if I find you cooler than me, haha-------- ૮(˶╥︿╥)ა, but don't worry reaching out to me! I love talking and when I'll get used to you I can talk about any topic, haha!

( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;)⁭ ⁭DNI = Basic DNI! All of shippers that get way too much into the ship. Toxic people, dramas stress me out. Lesbian fetishits (!!!!). Panic AU weirds me out, you can INT, but please don't expect me to respect the AU.

I usually sit in the Rain World area (Beside Hermitcraft, under the hill) or with Murder Drones people! (˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧ You can always C+H (unless I specifically ask you not to!).

I am an artist working mostly with 2D and animation! Please don't ask for free drawings, I have enough work on my head ദ്ദി ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ )! I'd love to draw something on your straw.page though, if you're in any fandoms I'm in!

I'm sorry if I make spelling mistakes, english is not my first language! I am polish, so I don't mind if you start the conversation in polish!

Please inform me if I make any mistake while talking to you and hurt your feelings, it's the last thing I want to do (◞‸ ◟)💧. I am neurodivergent and I may not understand everything directly, I would love tone tags! https://tonetags.carrd.co/#masterlist
